# Brace
Brace is a modern scripting language for TI-83 and TI-84 calculators. Brace is designed to make programming Texas Instrument calculators more easily and enjoyable.
Here's a list of useful features:
1. modern syntax of curly braces `{` and `}` instead of clumsy `Then` and `End`
2. arbitrarily nested `if`, `elif`, and `else`
3. user-defined functions with parameters
4. user-defined variables with friendly names
5. local scopes within functions
6. single and multi-line comments
7. more commonly used `==` as equality operator instead of `=` in TI-Basic
8. more commonly used `=` as assignment operator instead of weird `â†’` in TI-Basic
9. boolean operators `&&` (and) and `||` (or)
10. boolean values `true` and `false`
11. Multiple output formats for TI calculators, online TI-Basic IDE SourceCoder, and plain text. Each format treats special characters differently

All of the upon features aim at making coding less stressful, tedious and buggy.

## Installation
In the git repository, click "Brace.jar" and then click "download". After you downloaded the jar file, double click to execute it. If you cannot open the jar file, use command line to execut it. For Windows users, open cmd.exe, navigate to the directory where you stored the jar file and type `java.exe -jar Brace.jar`, then the Brace command line interface should appear.

## Usage
Brace.jar is a command line interface for you to convert a Brace file to TI-Basic file.

### 1. Convert Brace to TI-Basic
Here the demo of Brace CLI working in Windows 10:
![Brace CLI convert demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienKevin/Brace-lang/master/demo_images/CLI_convert.PNG "Brace CLI convert demo")
After you see the welcome message, type `convert` and hit ENTER. The prompt "Enter Brace file address" will show up. Enter your brace file address there. Then, the prompt "Enter TI-Basic file address" will show up. Enter your target TI-Basic file address (maybe empty an empty file or a file with content, ). All of the target TI-Basic file's contents will be replaced by the result of the conversion.

### 2. Make your life easier
