# Brace
Brace is a modern scripting language for TI-83 and TI-84 calculators. Brace is designed to make programming Texas Instrument calculators more easily and enjoyable.
Here's a list of useful features:
1. modern syntax of curly braces `{` and `}` instead of clumsy `Then` and `End`
2. arbitrarily nested `if`, `elif`, and `else`
3. user-defined functions with parameters
4. user-defined variables with friendly names
5. local scopes within functions
6. single and multi-line comments
7. more commonly used `==` as equality operator instead of `=` in TI-Basic
8. more commonly used `=` as assignment operator instead of weird `â†’` in TI-Basic
9. boolean operators `&&` (and) and `||` (or)
10. boolean values `true` and `false`
11. Multiple output formats for TI calculators, online TI-Basic IDE SourceCoder, and plain text. Each format treats special characters differently

All of the upon features aim at making coding less stressful, tedious and buggy.
